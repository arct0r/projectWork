organs were observed in 3160 and 4640 mg/kg dose groups.
Surviving animals recovered within 24 hours, and 215 mg/kg
was the nontoxic dose in this study. The LD50 values of 2240
(males) and 2200 (females) were reported.
In another study (OECD 423 test procedure) involving rats,
the LD50 for caprylyl glycol was >2500 mg/kg.27,
1,2-Butanediol. An acute oral LD50 of 4192 mg/kg was
reported for 1,2-butanediol in a study involving female Swiss
albino mice/ICR.28Study details were not provided. According
to a data summary available from Dow Chemical Company, the
acute oral LD50 for 1,2-butanediol in rats was 16 g/kg body
weight.29Also, high (unspecified) doses caused narcosis in rats
(often leading to death in a few hours), dilation of the blood
vessels, and kidney damage. 1,2-Butanediol administered
orally to rats (ethanol dependent) at a dose of 2.74 g/kg did
not induce any overt toxic effects.21
Pentylene glycol (1,2-pentanediol). The following acute oral
LD50 values have been reported for pentylene glycol: 1.2700
Eþ04 mg/kg (rats); 7400 mg/kg (mice); 3700 mg/kg (rabbits);
and 5200 mg/kg (guinea pigs).30
Stearyl glycol. An LD50 of >5000 mg/kg was reported for rats
dosed orally with stearyl glycol.30
C15-18 glycol. The acute oral toxicity of C15-18 glycol was
evaluated using adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, and an LD50
of >20.0 g/kg body weight was reported.5
Propylene glycol. The 24-hour oral LD50 for PG was 22.8 g/kg
body weight in a study involving 5 female Fischer rats. Oral
LD50 values (rats) of up to 27 g/kg body weight have been
reported in other studies.1
Dermal
1,2-Butanediol. According to a data summary provided by
Dow Chemical Company, prolonged application of 1,2-
butanediol to the skin of rabbits did not result in overt toxic
effects.21Details relating to the test procedure were not pro-
vided; however, it was presumed that neat material was tested.
Decylene glycol. In an acute dermal toxicity study invol-
ving rats, the LD50 for decylene glycol (SymClariol) was
>2000 mg/kg.27
Propylene glycol. The dermal LD50 for PG was >11.2 g/kg in
mice and was 13 g/kg in rats.1
Intraperitoneal
Caprylyl glycol, 1,2-butanediol, and pentylene glycol. In a report
by Shoemaker,31the intoxicating potency of alcohols, some
of which were straight-chain primary alcohols and straight-
chain diols, was determined . Data on the following 3 diols
reviewed in this safety assessment were included: caprylyl
glycol (1,2-octanediol), pentylene glycol (1,2-pentanediol),
and 1,2-butanediol. Doses o f each alcohol were injected
(intraperitoneally [ip]) into male Sprague-Dawley rats, andintoxicating scores were recorded based on the following
rating scale: 0 (normal) to 7 (death).
An ED 3value for each chemical was determined. The ED 3
was defined as the dose (mmole/kg body weight) required to
obtain a score of 3 (ataxia) on the intoxication rating scale (0-7
[death]). The following ED 3values were reported: 1.5 mmole/kg
(caprylyl glycol), 256.0 mmole/kg (pentylene glycol), and 32.6
mmole/kg (1,2-butanediol).31
Groups of 6 adult female, ICR Swiss albino mice were
injected ip with increasing doses of 1,2-butanediol (geometric
factor of 1.2) in distilled water (injection volume ¼0.01 mL/g
body weight). Mean LD50 values and 95 %confidence limits
were calculated from cumulative mortality curves at 24 hours
and 144 hours. The following values were reported for 1,2-
butanediol: 24-hour LD50 of 66.5 mmol/kg ( *5.99 g/kg) and
144-hour LD50 of 46.5 mmol/kg ( *4.19 mg/kg).32Muscle
incoordination was observed in rats at an ip dose of *2.94
g/kg 1,2-butanediol.21An ip TDLo of 3510 mg/kg has been
reported for pentylene glycol in rats.30
Propylene glycol. Following ip dosing with PG (5 mL/kg),
none of the 5 female C3H mice died, but peritonitis was
observed at necropsy. In other studies, ip LD 50 values up to
13.7 mL/kg (rats) and 11.2 g/kg (mice) have been reported.1An
acute study was performed in which female ICR mice were
dosed ip with 2600, 5200, or 10 400 mg/kg PG.33All except
the high-dose mice survived 6 days after dosing. Signs of toxi-
city, such as lethargy and ruffled hair coats, were not observed
in the 2600 and 5200 groups.2
Intravenous
Propylene glycol. Acute iv LD50s of 6.2 mL/kg (rats) and 6.4
mL/kg (mice) have been reported for PG. In other parenteral
toxicity studies, acute intramuscular (im) LD50 (20 g/kg rats)
and acute subcutaneous (sc) LD50 (18.5 g/kg mice) values
have been reported.1
Repeated-Dose Toxicity
Oral
Caprylyl glycol. In a 28-day oral toxicity study, >98 %caprylyl
glycol (Dermosoft Octiol) was administered to groups of
Wistar rats at doses of 50, 300, and 1000 mg/kg/d, respectively,
according to OECD guidelines.34The number of animals per
group was not stated and the control group was not identified.
The authors reported no test substance-related mortalities or
toxicologically relevant clinical signs during weeks 1 through
3 or week 4 (functional observational battery). Additionally,
there were no differences in feed consumption, body weight,
hematological/clinical biochemistry parameters, or macro-
scopic findings that were considered toxicologically relevant.
Test substance-related findings (males and females) included
slightly reduced locomotor activity and increased mean abso-
lute and relative kidney weights at the highest dose. Whether or
not microscopic changes were observed in the kidneys was not
stated.Johnson et al 155SSystemic effects were not observed at doses up to 300
mg/kg/d. Test substance-related microscopic changes were
observed in the stomach of rats in 300 and 1000 mg/kg/d dose
groups. These findings were considered indicative of an irritative
potential of the test substance on the pars nonglandularis and
limiting ridge of the stomach. The authors noted that analogous
structures do not exist in humans. Study results indicated a no
observed effect level (NOEL) of 50 mg/kg/d, and a no observed
adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 300 mg/kg/d for systemic toxi-
city. The NOAEL was based on the findings (irritation) in the
stomach, likely due to local irritation effects.34
1,2-Butanediol. In an 8-week oral study, groups of rats were
fed 1,2-butanediol at concentrations ranging from 5 %to 40%
in the basic diet (1 dose level per group).21A control group
only received basic diet. There were no mortalities at the lowest
dose (*2.9 g/kg body weight/d); however, doses /C2110%were
classified as fatal. The following signs of toxicity were noted at
the highest dose of 22 g/kg/d: weight loss, fatigue, reduced
responsiveness, diarrhea, and rapid, shallow breathing. No
abnormalities were observed in tissues of major organs from
2 rats at each of the 5 dose levels.
The following study is actually a combined repeated dose/
reproductive and developmental toxicity study, and the results
relating to reproductive and developmental toxicity appear in
that section later in the report text.35Groups of Crj-CD(SD) rats
(10 males and 10 females) were dosed orally, by gavage, with
aqueous 1,2-butanediol at doses of 40, 200, or 1000 mg/kg/d.
Males were dosed daily for 42 days, and females were dosed
from day 14 before mating to day 3 of lactation. Control rats (10
males and 10 females) were dosed with distilled water.
None of the animals died, and there were no differences in
histopathological findings or the following parameters between
test and control animals: body weights, feed consumption,
hematology parameters, clinical chemistry parameters, and
organ weights. However, transient hypolocomotion and hypop-
nea (slight clinical signs) were observed in females that
received 1000 mg/kg doses. N o observable effect levels
(NOELs) for repeat dose toxicity were 1000 mg/kg/d (males)
and 200 mg/kg/d (females). The no observable adverse effect
level (NOAEL) was 200 mg/kg body weight/day in this
study.35
According to a summary of data provided by Dow Chemical
Company, the administration of large (unspecified) doses of
1,2-butanediol to rats caused irritation of the gastrointestinal
tract.21
Decylene glycol. In a 28-day oral toxicity study, 98 %to 100%
decylene glycol (SymClariol) was administered to groups of
SPF-bred Wistar rats (5 males, 5 females/group) at doses of
100, 300, and 1000 mg/kg/d, respectively, according to OECD
guidelines.36The vehicle control group received 2.5 %ethanol
in distilled water. Rats in each group were killed after day 28.
Two additional groups (same composition) were untreated and
dosed with 1000 mg/kg/d, respectively, for 28 days. The ani-
mals in these groups were killed after a 14-day nontreatmentperiod. In all groups, a functional observational battery was
performed (week 4) before animals were killed. All of the
animals survived the 28-day dosing period, and there were no
toxicologically relevant clinical signs during the study. Mean
locomotor activity was significantly reduced in males and
females in the 1000 mg/kg/d dose group, and this finding was
deemed test substance related. Decreased feed consumption
was also noted in females at this dose level. Mean body weights
of males and females were similar to those of negative control
animals.
There were no test substance-related differences in hemato-
logical or clinical biochemical parameters that were of toxico-
logical relevance. The presence of ketone in the urine of males
and females of the 1000 mg/kg/d dose group was considered
likely representative of metabolic adaptation to the test sub-
stance. Both absolute and relative organ weights of dosed
animals were comparable to those of negative control rats.
Toxicologically relevant macroscopic findings were not
observed. Squamous epithelial h yperplasia, ulceration, and
inflammation of the forestomach were observed at doses of
1000 mg/kg/d, and squamous epithelial hyperplasia of the for-
estomach was less severe and occurred at a lower incidence in
the of 300 mg/kg/d dose group. After a 14-day recovery period,
squamous epithelial hyperpla sia remained in the animals
previously dosed with 1000 mg/kg/d, but the severity and inci-
dence of this finding after the treatment period was largely
reversible. Both the NOEL and the NOAEL in this study was
100 mg/kg body weight/d.36
Pentylene glycol. Pentylene glycol was administered orally
to rats, intermittently over a 28-week period. A TDLo of
2450mg/kg was reported.30
Propylene glycol. A 92- to 97-day study was conducted to
assess the safety and tolerability of PG as an alternative for-
mulation vehicle in general toxicology studies in the mouse,
rat, dog, and monkey.37In Sprague-Dawley (Crl:CD[SD]VAF/
Plus) rats (10/sex; 6 +1 weeks old) and CD1 (Crl:CD1[Icr]-
VAF/Plus) mice (10/sex; 6 +1 weeks old), the vehicle was
administered orally via gavage at dose volumes of 5 mL/kg
(rats) and 10 mL/kg (mice) for 92 to 93 days. In Beagle dogs
(4/sex; 7 to17 months old) and cynomolgus monkeys ( Macaca
fascicularis , 4/sex; juvenile to young adult), the vehicle was
administered orally by gavage (dose ¼1000 mg/kg; dose vol-
ume of 5 mL/kg) for 95 to 97 days. Effects on clinical observa-
tions, body weight, food consum ption parameters, clinical
pathology, and histopathology were evaluated across all
species. The suitability of formulations containing up to 1000
mg/kg PG for use in preclinical safety studies was confirmed
by a lack of effects on all parameters examined.37
No significant toxicity was observed in oral studies of PG
involving dogs and cats. Dogs received 3.0 mL/kg doses of
undiluted PG over a 3-day period, and cats received 12 %PG
in the diet for 5 weeks and 41 %PG in the diet for 22 days.
Short-term iv dosing with PG resulted in little toxicity in rats.
Groups of rats received iv infusions of PG/ethanol/water156S International Journal of Toxicology 31(Supplement 2)results for the 3 in vitro assays indicate that the lash gel serum
might be a slight ocular irritant, with a Draize score that might
range from 0 to 15. The conclusion for this study (slight ocular
irritant) is from a global assessment conducted by the Interna-
tional Research and Development Center that was based on
results of the 3 methods used, because no single alternative
method can predict ocular irritation with a sufficient level of
safety.43
Decylene glycol. In an ocular irritation study (OECD 405
protocol) involving rabbits, decylene glycol (SymClariol)
induced corrosion when tested at a concentration of 100 %.
Additionally, the ocular irritation potential of 1 %SymClariol
in neutral oil was evaluated in the HET-CAM assay, and the
results were negative.27
Lauryl glycol. According to Worth and Cronin,44the European
Union has classified 1,2-dodecanediol (lauryl glycol) as a
severe ocular irritant. The European classification system has
allowed 2 classes of acute eye toxicity, R36 for moderate irri-
tants and R41 for severe irritants, and the Draize eye test has
been used for the identification of R41 chemicals. Actual
Draize test results for lauryl glycol were not included. This
classification of lauryl glycol as a severe ocular irritant is
included in a study by the preceding authors to explore the
possibility of distinguishing between eye irritants and nonirri-
tants by using in vitro end points of the HET-CAM assay and
the neutral red uptake (NRU) test.
According to one of the prediction models for eye irritation
potential, a chemical is more likely to be an eye irritant if its log
(TH10) value is low (ie, if a 10 %solution of the chemical
produces rapid hemorrhaging of the chorioallantoic membrane)
and if its log (IC 50) value is low (i.e., if the chemical is
cytotoxic to 3T3 cells). TH10 is defined as the mean detection
time (units not stated) for hemorrhage in the vascularized chor-
ioallantoic membrane of embryonated chicken eggs. The IC50
is defined as the concentration of test chemical (mg/ml) result-
ing in 50 %inhibition of NRU in 3T3 cells. The TH10 and IC50
values for lauryl glycol were 171.0 and 0.02, respectively.44
Using a logarithm calculator, log 0.02 ¼/C0 1.70 and
log 171.0 ¼2.23.
Propylene glycol. PG (0.1 mL, pH 8.8) was a slight ocular
irritant in rabbits in 1 study, but PG (0.1 mL, pH unknown)
did not induce ocular irritation in another study involving
rabbits.1The ocular irritation potential of PG was determined
using groups of 6 male and female New Zealand white albino
rabbits. Following instillation of a single drop and multiple
instillations, slight-to-moderate conjunctival hyperemia was
observed and all reactions had cleared by day 3.2
Skin Irritation and Sensitization
Caprylyl glycol. The skin sensitization potential of caprylyl
glycol was evaluated in the g uinea pig maximization test
(OECD 406 protocol) using 20 animals. During intradermal
and topical induction, caprylyl glycol was applied atconcentrations of 5 %(in peanut oil) and 50 %(in petrolatum).
The challenge concentration was 50 %in petrolatum. Sensitiza-
tion was not observed in any of the animals tested.41
1,2-Butanediol. According to a summary of data provided by
Dow Chemical Company, 1,2-butanediol did not induce skin
irritation in rabbits following prolonged and repeated applica-
tion.21Details regarding the test procedure were not provided;
however, it was presumed that neat material was used.
1,2-Hexanediol. The sensitization potential of 1,2-hexanediol
was evaluated at concentrations of 10 %,5 0%, and 100 %in
acetone/olive (3:1) using the mouse local lymph node assay
(OECD 429 protocol). Study results were negative for skin
sensitization.45
Decylene glycol. In a skin irritation study (OECD 404 proto-
col) involving rabbits, 100 %decylene glycol (SymClariol) was
classified as a moderate skin irritant (PII ¼3.2). SymClariol
was evaluated at the following concentrations in the guinea pig
maximization test: 1 %in arachis oil (intradermal induction),
5%in arachis oil (topical induction), and 2 %and 5%in arachis
oil (challenge). Sensitization was not observed in any of the
19 guinea pigs tested.27
The skin sensitization potential of SymClariol was also
evaluated at the following test concentrations in the mouse
local lymph node assay: 5 %,1 0%,2 5%, and 50 %in acetone/
olive oil (4:1). Sensitization was not recorded at any of the
concentrations tested.27
Propylene glycol. In nude mice, hypertrophy, dermal inflam-
mation, and proliferation were observed with 50 %PG, but
undiluted PG was, at most, a mild dermal irritant in a Draize
test using rabbits with intact and abraded skin. No reactions
to undiluted PG were observed with guinea pigs, rabbits, or
Gottingen swine. PG (concentrations not given) was negative
in a number of sensitization/allergenicity assays using guinea
pigs, but, in another study, PG (0.5 mL) was a weak sensitizer
in guinea pigs.1
The dermal irritation potential of 100 %PG was evaluated
using male hairless SKH1 hr/hr mice. The PG was minimally
irritating, with a total score of 7 (maximum score ¼77).2
Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity
1,2-Butanediol. The test procedure for the combined repea-
ted dose and reproductive/developmental toxicity study
(Crj-CD(SD) rats) and results relating to oral toxicity are
included in the Short-Term Oral Toxicity section earlier in
the reported text. All of the animals were killed on day 4 of
lactation. Neither effects on reproduction (copulation, implan-
tation, pregnancy, parturition, or lactation) nor developmental
toxicity effects on offspring were observed. The NOAEL was
1000 mg/kg for parental animals and the F 1generation.35The
estimated dose of low concern (EDCL) for this study was
calculated as 10 mg/kg/d, using an NOAEL of 1000 mg/kg/d
and a reproductive toxicity uncertainty factor of 100.7158S International Journal of Toxicology 31(Supplement 2)There were no significant toxic effects in rats exposed for
7 hours to an atmosphere saturated with 1,2-butanediol. Acute
oral toxicity data on caprylyl glycol and other 1,2-glycols for
which data are available suggest that death would occur at
relatively high doses (LD50 range: 2200 to >20 000 mg/kg).
Reportedly, high (unspecified) oral doses of 1,2-butanediol
caused narcosis, dilation of the blood vessels, and kidney dam-
age in rats. Overt toxic effects were not observed in ethanol-
dependent rats dosed orally with 2.74 g/kg 1,2-butanediol.
The available data suggest that 1,2-butanediol (LD50s up to
5.99 g/kg) and pentylene glycol (TDLo ¼3.51 g/kg) are not
significant acute ip toxicants. However, muscle incoordination
w a so b s e r v e di nr a t sa ta ni pd o s eo f *2.94 g/kg. In an ip dosing
study in which ED 3values for caprylyl glycol (1,2-octanediol),
pentylene glycol (1,2-pentanediol), and 1,2-butanediol were
compared, caprylyl glycol had the lowest ED 3value (1.5
mmole/kg), suggesting that its intoxication potency (ie, ability
to induce ataxia) was greatest. In an acute dermal toxicity study
involving rats, the LD50 for decylene glycol (SymClariol) was
>2000 mg/kg. Prolonged application or repeated applications of
1,2-butanediol to the skin of rabbits did not result in overt toxic
effects.
An NOEL of 50 mg/kg/d and anNOAEL of 300 mg/kg/d for
systemic toxicity in rats were reported in a 28-day oral toxicity
study on >98 %caprylyl glycol (Dermosoft Octiol). The NOAEL
was based on the findings of irritation on the pars nonglandularis
and limiting ridge of the stomach; analogous structures do not
exist in man. An NOAEL of 100 mg/kg/d was reported for rats
in a 28-day oral toxicity study on decylene glycol (SymClariol).
Short-term oral administration of 1,2-butanediol to rats yielded
an NOAEL of 200 mg/kg/d. Reportedly, in another repeated
dose study, the administration of large (unspecified) doses of
1,2-butanediol to rats caused i rritation of the gastrointes-
tinal tract. Signs of toxicity were noted at the highest dose of
22 g/kg/d in rats receiving 1,2-butanediol in the diet for up to
8 weeks; abnormalities were not observed in tissues from major
organs. Intermittent oral administration of pentylene glycol to
rats over a 28-week period yielded a TDLo of 2450mg/kg. In a
92- to 97-day oral toxicity study involving mice, rats, dogs, and
monkeys dosed with a formulation containing PG (dose ¼1000
mg/kg), there were no adverse effects on body weight, feed
consumption, clinical pathology, histopathology, or adverse
clinical observations.
Cetyl glycol (130 mg/mL) had a cytocidal effect on EAC
cells, lauryl glycol (99 mmol/L) had a hemolytic effect on
human erythrocytes, and pentylene glycol (5 %) induced apop-
tosis in a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line in vitro.
Based on Draize test results, lauryl glycol has been classified
as a severe ocular irritant. Undiluted 1,2-butanediol, but not
10%aqueous, induced ocular irritation in rabbits. Undiluted
decylene glycol (SymClariol) induced corrosion when
instilled into the eyes of rabbits. In an in vitro ocular irritation
assay (HET-CAM), 1 %SymClariol in neutral oil and caprylyl
glycol (1 %and 3%) in neutral oil were classified as nonirri-
tants; however, a 50:50 (w/w) mixture of caprylyl glycol and
1,2-hexanediol was classified as a severe ocular irritant whenevaluated at a concentration of 1 %aqueous (effective concen-
tration per ingredient ¼0.5%) in the same assay. Together, the
results of an NRR assay, the HET-CAM assay, and the REC
assay indicated that a lash gel serum containing 3 %pentylene
glycol might be a slight ocular irritant.
In the guinea pig maximization test, results were negative
for caprylyl glycol at a challenge concentration of 50 %in
petrolatum. Undiluted decylene glycol (SymClariol) was clas-
sified as a moderate skin irritant in rabbits but did not induce
sensitization in the guinea pig maximization test at challenge
concentrations of 2 %and 5%in arachis oil or in the mouse
local lymph node assay at concentrations of 5 %to 50%in
acetone/olive oil (4:1). Repeated applications of 1,2-butylene
glycol to the skin of rabbits did not result in skin irritation, and
results were negative for 1,2-hexanediol (10 %to 100%)i nt h e
mouse local lymph node assay for evaluating sensitization
potential.
An NOAEL of 1000 mg/kg for reproductive/developmental
toxicity has been reported for 1,2-butanediol in rats dosed
orally. In a prenatal developmental toxicity study involving
rats, an NOEL of 300 mg/kg was reported for 1,2-hexanediol.
Caprylyl glycol >98 %(Dermosoft Octiol) did not induce
gene mutations in Chinese hamster V79 cells (concentrations
up to 1480 mg/mL) and >98 %caprylyl glycol (ADEKA NOL
OG) did not induce chromosomal aberrations in Chinese
hamster lung cells (concentrations up to 700 mg/mL) in vitro.
Decylene glycol (SymClariol) was nongenotoxic in the Ames
test, and 1,2-butanediol was not genotoxic in assays involving
bacterial cells (doses up to 5000 mg/plate) or mammalian cells
(doses up to 0.9 mg/mL). Marked antitumor effects of cetyl
glycol were observed in mice in vivo following ip doses of
80 mg/kg/d. Cetyl glycol (130 mg/mL) was found to have a
cytocidal effect (irreversible cell degeneration) on cultured
EAC cells.
Results were negative for skin irritation and sensitization
potential in RIPTs in which 105 participants were patch tested
with a lipstick containing 0.5 %caprylyl glycol and 101 parti-
cipants were patch tested with a leg and foot gel containing
0.5%1,2-hexanediol. An in-use test of a body wash containing
0.15%1,2-hexanediol did not result in skin irritation or sensi-
tization reactions in 28 participants. 1,2-hexanediol/caprylyl
glycol mixture (in preservative system) was nonsensitizing at
a concentration of 0.5 %or 15%in an RIPT involving 205
human participants. Skin sensitization also was not observed
in another RIPT in which 56 participants were tested with a
50:50 (w/w) mixture of 1,2-hexanediol and caprylyl glycol
(Symdiol 68; effective concentration per ingredient ¼10%).
Decylene glycol (SymClariol) did not induce skin irritation in
52 participants or sensitization (RIPT) in 55 participants patch
tested at a concentration of 20 %in petrolatum. However,
SymClariol (1 %in neutral oil) had low skin irritation potential
when applied to scarified skin in a group of 10 participants, and
very slight stinging potential when tested at concentrations of
1%and 2%in neutral oil in 10 participants. A foundation
containing 0.112 %pentylene glycol did not induce skin irrita-
tion or sensitization in an RIPT involving 101 participants.Johnson et al 163SPositive reactions were observed in a patient patch tested with
0.5%and 5%1,2-pentylene glycol but not in the control group.
Propylene Glycol
In mammals, the major pathway of PG metabolism is to
lactaldehyde and then lactate via hepatic alcohol and aldehyde
dehydrogenases. When PG was administered iv to human
participants (patients), elimination from the body occurred in
a dose-dependent manner.
Dermal penetration of PG from a ternary cosolvent solution
through hairless mouse skin was 57 %over a 24-hour period.
Using thermal emission decay (TED)-Fourier transform infra-
red (FTIR) spectroscopy, it appeared that PG did not reach the
dermis.
Propylene glycol is a penetration enhancer for some chemi-
cals and, under some conditions, in human participants, and can
act synergistically with other enhancers. The mechanism by
which PG enhances penetration has not been identified.
Based on the 1994 safety assessment and more recent infor-
mation, few toxic effects were seen in dosing with PG. The oral
LD50of PG was >21 g/kg for rats. The dermal LD 50of PG was
>11.2 g/kg for mice and was 13 g/kg for rats. Mortalities were
observed in mice at the highest ip dose of PG (10 400 mg/kg).
All mice survived in a short-term study in which mice were
given 10 %PG in drinking water for 14 days, and all rats
and mongrel dogs survived oral dosing with up to 3.0 mL
100%PG, 3 times per day, for 3 days. In a subchronic study,
a dose of /C2050 000 ppm PG given in the feed for 15 weeks did
not produce any lesions. Subchronic inhalation data reported
some effects in rats due to PG exposure of 2.2 mg/L air for 6
hours/day, 5 days/week, for 13 weeks, but these effects were
inconsistent and without dose-response trends. In the 1994
safety assessment, no toxic effects were reported in chronic
studies when rats or dogs were given feed containing 50 g/kg
or 5 g/kg, respectively, PG.
Undiluted PG was, at most, a slight ocular irritant. Dermal
irritation studies were reported in the 1994 CIR final safety
assessment and in the amended final safety assessment. In one
study using nude mice, 50 %PG may have caused skin irritation,
while in another study, 100 %PG was minimally irritating to
hairless mice. Hypertrophy, dermal inflammation, and prolifera-
tion were also observed with 50 %PG in nude mice. These
effects were not seen in hairless mice with undiluted PG. Undi-
luted PG was at most a mild dermal irritant in a Draize test using
rabbits with intact and abraded skin. No reactions to undiluted
PG were observed with guinea pigs, rabbits, or Gottingen swine.
Propylene glycol (concentrations not given) was negative in a
number of sensitization assays using guinea pigs. In a study
using guinea pigs, 0.5 mL PG was a weak sensitizer.
Oral administration of PG did not have any adverse repro-

Embryonic development was reduced or inhibited completely in
cultures of mouse zygotes exposed to 3.0 or 6.0 mol/L PG,respectively. A study examini ng induction of cytogenetic
aberrations in mice reported an increase in the frequency of
premature centrosphere separation with 1300 to 5200 mg/kg
PG. In zygotes from PG-dosed mice, hyperploidy was increased.
Propylene glycol, /C2010 000 mg/plate, was not mutagenic in
Ames tests with or without metabolic activation. Propylene
glycol, tested at concentrations of 3.8 to 22.8 mg/mL, was a
weak but potential inducer of SCEs, causing a dose-dependent
increase in SCEs in a Chinese hamster cell line. However,
in another SCE assay using human cultured fibroblasts and
Chinese hamster cells with and without metabolic activation,
PG was not mutagenic. Propylene glycol, 32 mg/mL, induced
chromosomal aberrations in a Chinese hamster fibroblast line
but not in human embryonic cells. Propylene glycol was not
mutagenic in mitotic recombination or base pair substitution
assays, or in a micronucleus test or a hamster embryo cell
transformation assay.
Propylene glycol was not carcinogenic in a 2-year chronic
study in which rats were given /C2050 000 ppm PG in the diet.
Dermal application of undiluted PG to Swiss mice in a lifetime
study produced no significant carcinogenic effects. Propylene
glycol was not carcinogenic in other oral, dermal, and subcu-
taneous studies.
Combined exposure to PG and oleic acid synergistically
enhanced the dermal penetration of both compounds. Addition
of PG to an isopropanol vehicle enhanced the irritant reactions
of benzoic acid; maximal enhancement was seen with 5 %PG.
Propylene glycolinduced skin irritation reactions in nor-
mal participants and in patient s. Reactions were observed at
concentrations as low as 10 %in predictive tests and 2 %in
provocative tests. Use studie s of deodorants containing 35 %
to 73%PG did not report any potential for eliciting irritation
or sensitization. Propylene glycol generally did not induce
sensitization reactions when tested at 12 %to 86%, although
results were questionable in an RIPT of a deodorant contain-
ing 73%PG. Additionally, in a modifi ed Draize sensitization
study with 203 participants, PG (0.2 mL, concentration not
stated) induced 19 cutaneous reactions at challenge. Propy-
lene glycol did not produce a p hotoallergic response in a
provocative photopatch test. Re trospective analysis of pools
of patient patch test data indicated that /C206.0%of patients
tested had positive reactions to 30 %aq PG. A few case reports
concerning PG and hand dermatitis or atopic dermatitis have
been described, and positive reac tions were reported. Patients
with diseased skin may be at risk with respect to developing
irritation/se nsitization reactions to PG.
Discussion
The available safety test data for 1,2-glycols indicate that
they are not significant acute toxicants, are not significantly
genotoxic, are noncarcinogenic, and are not significant dermal
irritants, sensitizers, or photosensitizers. Data on the following
1,2-glycols were reviewed: ca prylyl glycol, lauryl glycol,
stearyl glycol, decylene glycol, pentylene glycol, 1,2-
butanediol, 1,2-hexanediol, C15-18 glycol, and PG. Many of164S International Journal of Toxicology 31(Supplement 2)
